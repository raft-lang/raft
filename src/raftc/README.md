## Self-hosting compiler

This is Raft compiler written in Raft.

### Compiler bootstrapping has the following advantages:

- Compiler developers only need to know the language being compiled.
- Compiler improvements not only improve other programs in Raft, but also the compiler itself.
- This is a pretty good language and compiler tryout.
